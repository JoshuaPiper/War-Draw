# War-Draw
A long-time project on a unique chess-based iOS game made by Codea

This is a game that I invented during middle school. And I am trying to export it into a digital version.

This game basically a dice-chess game but have multiple choices for every step.
Currently in progress. (It should be quicker if I didn't reset my iPad :-< )
